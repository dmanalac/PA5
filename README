	The build.xml contains targets for compiling and running your
	program, as well as handing it in. DO NOT MODIFY.

	The README contains this info. Part of the assignment is to
	fill the README with the write-up for your project. You should
	explain design decisions, explain why your code is correct,
	and why your test cases are adequate. It is part of the
	assignment to clearly and concisely explain things in text as
	well as to comment your code.  Also, please provide feedback
	on Coolaid by answering the questions below.

	In example.cl, you should write a correct Cool program which
	tests as many aspects of the code generator as possible. It
	should pass your code generator, and running spim on the
	generated output should run the program correctly.

	CgenClassTable.java and CgenNode.java are the skeleton files for
	the code generator. These skeletons are much larger than the
	ones for previous assignments.  The skeletons provides three
	components of the code generator:

		- functions to build the inheritance graph; (we supply
		  this in case you didn't get this working for PA4)

		- functions to emit global data and constants;
		 
	You should work to understand this code, and it will help you
        write the rest of the code generator.

        tests is a directory containing six test cases. Your checkpoint
        submission will be graded by this test cases.

        TreeNode.java and ListNode.java contain definitions used by
        the tree package. DO NOT MODIFY.

        cool-tree.java specifies and give an implementation of Cool
        ASTs (see the README for PA3 and the "Cool Tour").  In this
        assignment, you will need to complete the code generating
        methods for all Cool expression nodes.

	BoolConst.java, IntSymbol.java, and StringSymbol.java are used
        to manage constants in Cool programs.  You will need to
        complete the method for generating constant definitions in
        each of these classes.

	CgenSupport.java is general support code for the code
	generator.  You can add functions and constants as you see
	fit, but do not modify anything that's already there.  This
	class also serves as a placeholder for a bunch of constants as
	well as functions to emit spim instructions (we supply these
	to save you some tedious coding).

	TreeConstants.java defined some useful symbol constants.  You
	may add some of your own, if you wish.

	ASTLexer.java, ASTParser.java, and ASTConstants.java implement
	a lexer and a parser for reading text representation of ASTs
	from console in the format produced by the parser phase. DO
	NOT MODIFY.

	Cgen.java supplies the driver for the compiler. You should not
        modify this code.  The script mycoolc can pass any of the
        standard flags to the code generator; for this assignment, -c
        (code generator debug) may be useful as it sets a global
        variable cgen_debug to true (1).  If you want your code
        generator to print debug information when the option is set,
        write your debug code in the following format:

	      if (cgen_debug)
	      {
		...
	      }

	SymbolTable.java contains a symbol table implementation. Read
	the comments in the file and look at the example in
	SymtabExample.java.  You are not required to use this code,
	but you may find it useful. DO NOT MODIFY.

Instructions
------------

	To compile your compiler and code generator type:

	% ant cgen

	To test your compiler, type:

	% ./mycoolc [-o output filename] <file1.cl> <file2.cl> ...

	This command parses all the cool files given on the command
	line, passes them through the semantic checker, and then hands
	the program AST to your code generator.  It will also
        include in your generated code annotations that are needed
        by Coolaid.

	To run your compiler on the file example.cl, type:

	% ant test

        To run Coolaid on your output, type:

        % coolaid file1.s

	To run the produced code:

	% spim -file file1.s  /* or the output filename you chose */

	To turn in your work at checkpoint, type:
        
        % ant submit-clean
        % submit PA5-checkpoint

        To turn in your work finally, type:

        % ant submit-clean
        % submit PA5
        
        Be sure to submit all relevant source files.  
        In particular, you probably want to turn in cool-tree.java, 
        TreeConstants.java, BoolConst.java, IntSymbol.java, StringSymbol.java,
        CgenNode.java, CgenClassTable.java, CgenSupport.java, example.cl, README.
	
	You may turn in the assignment as many times as you like.
	However, only the last version will be retained for grading.
	
	GOOD LUCK!

Coolaid Feedback (optional)
----------------------------
1. Rate Coolaid's usefulness on a scale from 0 to 6 where 0
   means that it was counter-productive, 3 means that it neither
   helped nor hindered you, and 6 means that you can't imagine
   developing/debugging a code generator without it.



2. What aspects of Coolaid particularly helped you?





3. What aspects of Coolaid would you like to see improved?






4. Describe bugs, if any, that Coolaid helped you find or fix?






5. Do you have any additional comments you would like to share
   with us?
